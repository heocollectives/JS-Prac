    <title>Control Statements: For Loops</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        //works similarly to a while loop, instead of testing the condition, a number is specified to run how many loops to run
        // for (i=0 ;(start point) i < 2;(end point) i++ (the change -- ++ etc.)) { //Do something}
        // the 'while' is changed with a 'for' and the value 'var' is within the (statement)

        // for (i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        //     console.log(i);
        // } A for loop is a syntactic sugar: it sweetens up the syntax to make it easier for devs to code

        //Use while loop: is checking for a state while it's true, repetitively run an instruction while the program is in a certain state.
        //For loops: used to iterate, run a piece of code many times to define a certain number of times (most pref for repetitive tasks)
